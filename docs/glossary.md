# Glossary

- **Abstraction** An abstraction is an interface or a class. Every class is also an abstraction, however, the focus hereby is that it is a root of a inheritance hierarchy and therfore potentially represents a bigger group of implementations.
- **Collection Injection** The term for injecting types like `IEnumerable<…>`, `IReadOnlyList<…>`, or `IReadOnlyCollection<…>`.
- **Container** In context of DIE it is a class generated by DIE which knows how to instantiate user-selected types. The DIE-container uses pure dependency injection instead of utilizing reflection like more traditional container projects. Depending on the context in this documentation the term container could also have the general meaning.
- **Factory Injection** The term for injecting types like `Lazy<…>` or `Func<…>`. In this context `Lazy<…>` can be understood as a parameterless one-off factory. 
- **Implementation** An implementation is a non-abstract class or a struct or their non-abstract record-variants. Hence, an implementation is a class or struct which is instantiateable by the `new`-operator.
- **Instance Injection** An injection for an ordinary type with an ordinary instance.
- **Scope Injection** An injection which starts a new scope or transient scope. The injected instances are scope- or transient-scope-roots.
