# Glossary

- **Abstraction** An abstraction is an interface or a class. Every class is also an abstraction, however, the focus hereby is that it is a root of a inheritance hierarchy and therfore potentially represents a bigger group of implementations.
- **Container** In context of DIE it is a class generated by DIE which knows how to instantiate user-selected types. The DIE-container uses pure dependency injection instead of utilizing reflection like more traditional container projects. Depending on the context in this documentation the term container could also have the general meaning.
- **Implementation** An implementation is a non-abstract class or a struct or their non-abstract record-variants. Hence, an implementation is a class or struct which is instantiateable by the `new`-operator.
